Key Components Identified:
1. Multi-cloud deployment (GCP and Alibaba Cloud) suggests global distribution
2. Patient data management implies strict medical data compliance (HIPAA, GDPR)
3. File sharing system needs to handle medical imaging (DICOM, X-rays)
4. Order management suggests payment processing and scheduling
5. gRPC indicates need for high-performance microservices

Additional Considerations:
- Medical systems require high availability and data integrity
- Cross-border data compliance for global operations
- Integration with medical imaging equipment and standards
- Real-time collaboration needs for medical professionals
- Audit trails for medical records
